# 2. I used the MAX and MIN functions in Excel to determine the highest and lowest prices of wines in the dataset, and used VLOOKUP to find the names of the wines with those prices. Through this process, I discovered that the price range of wines in the dataset is from $4 to $3,300, and the wine with the highest maximum price is the Bordeaux-style Red Blend.

# 3. I utilized the COUNTIF and AVERAGEIF functions to determine the number of tastings conducted by each taster as well as the average rating they gave.

# 5. Used Pivot table to display the top 10 countries with the highest average price of wine.This information was then visually represented using a chart to better understand the price differences between each country. The countries are ranked based on their average wine prices, with Colares from Portugal having the highest average price followed by VÃ¢nju Mare from Romania and Switzerland. Other countries on the list include Madeira from Portugal, Moscatel do Douro from Portugal, Puente Alto from Chile, Buin from Chile, Rheingau from Germany, Champagne from France, and Santa Cruz from Argentina. These findings suggest that certain regions and countries are known for producing high-quality and expensive wines.

# 6. Using a pivot table, I grouped the wines by their variety and calculated the average ratings. I then created a chart to visually represent the top-rated varieties, which include Tinta del Pais, Terrantez, and Gelber Traminer, all with a rating of 95.

# 7. I used a pivot table to count the number of wine varieties produced by the top 10 wineries in the dataset.

# 8. I used a pivot table to analyze the wine dataset and identify the most expensive wines along with their prices. I then created a chart to visually represent this information. To provide additional functionality, I also added a slicer to allow users to filter the data by country.

# 9. I used a pivot table to determine the number of wineries in each country, and the result is the top 10 countries with the highest count of wineries.

# 10. This pivot table shows the average rating of wines grouped by price range. As the price range increases, so does the average rating, with the highest average rating of 96.36 given to wines in the $800-899 price range. However, there are some exceptions, such as the $1500-1599 range, where the average rating is 100.
