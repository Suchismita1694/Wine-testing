2. I used the MAX and MIN functions in Excel to determine the highest and lowest prices of wines in the dataset, and used VLOOKUP to find the names of the wines with those prices. Through this process, I discovered that the price range of wines in the dataset is from $4 to $3,300, and the wine with the highest maximum price is the Bordeaux-style Red Blend.

3. I utilized the COUNTIF and AVERAGEIF functions to determine the number of tastings conducted by each taster as well as the average rating they gave.
